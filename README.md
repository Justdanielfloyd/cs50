## Introduction

CS50 is an entry-level course taught by David Malan at Harvard University. The course covers foundational concepts in computer science, programming languages, and software development. Each task builds upon the previous one, allowing me to enhance my problem-solving skills and understanding of algorithms.

## Tasks Overview

Here are the CS50 tasks included in this repository:

1. **Caesar**  
   A program that implements the Caesar cipher, a basic encryption technique.

2. **Cash**  
   A program that calculates the minimum number of coins needed to give a user change.

3. **Client**  
   A program that connects to a server and communicates using TCP.

4. **Filter (Less Comfortable)**  
   A program that applies filters to an image, including grayscale and reflection.

5. **Hello**  
   A simple program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console.

6. **Mario (Less Comfortable)**  
   A program that creates a pyramid of specified height using hashes.

7. **Mario (More Comfortable)**  
   An enhanced version of the Mario pyramid that includes user-defined heights and spacing.

8. **Plurality**  
   A program that implements a plurality voting system to determine election winners.

9. **Readability**  
   A program that determines the readability of a text using the Coleman-Liau index.

10. **Runoff**  
    A program that implements a runoff voting system to determine election winners.

11. **Scrabble**  
    A program that scores words based on Scrabble rules.

12. **Sort**  
    A program that implements various sorting algorithms to sort an array of numbers.

13. **Substitution**  
    A program that implements a substitution cipher for encrypting messages.

14. **Volume**  
    A program that generates a pyramid of specified height with different volumes.
